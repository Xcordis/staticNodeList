# staticNodeList

## descriptors
```C++
This project is a static linked list in C++. Its data structure is a double linked list. The reason for adopting this data structure is that many functions can be realized, and the time complexity is O(1). Of course, the current program still has a problem, that is, how to reuse the pop-up space.
